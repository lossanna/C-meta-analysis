column	details
paper		first author last name and year
biome		as defined by paper (with some adjustments to standardize categories)
climate	as defined by paper (if provided)
region	defined after considering entire available dataset
dur		entire study duration in months (time since first C application to harvest/measurement time); when papers tested treatments of multiple durations (probably because they added different types of C at different times), the longest is used to capture the extent of long-term monitoring in studies (latest harvest point is still used)
ctyp1-4	type of C added; columns 2-4 are if they tested multiple C types, otherwise are left blank
cratav	units of g C/m2 per year; (missing data means that rate could not be calculated, likely because C mass was not provided); averaged if paper tested multiple C rates, and averages are not weighted based on numbers of comparisons used in meta-analysis
capr		yes/no of multiple applications
ctypm		if multiple C types were tested
cratm		if paper used tested multiple C rates (if so, they are averaged in cratav column, and the range is given here)
mtrt1-3	if paper tested C addition with multiple treatments (to see interactions; burning, grazing, watering); additional treatments in combination with C are listed; treatments had to have controls to be counted
mtrtn		number of additional treatments
plot		size of plots in m2 (size is the area C was applied to/relevant treatment area)
cost		if paper mentioned cost; possible values are "absent", "mentioned briefly" (usually just a sentence), "discussed" (if they talk about cost in relation to the actual findings of their study), "numbers" (if any actual figures for cost were provided)
scrn3		if paper passed screen 3 and was included in meta-analysis
