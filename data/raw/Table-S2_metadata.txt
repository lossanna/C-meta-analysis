column		details
paper			first author last name and year
cross			a crossed treatment (to identify/clarify observation only, not for analysis)
paper_ID		a few papers are combined because they are about the same experiment
exp_ID		an experiment occurs in the same location, over the same time period (roughly), executed by the same people; this is used to address non-independence
obs_ID		observation ID (every row is an observation); this is to address non-independence
biome			as defined by paper (with some adjustments to standardize categories)
region		defined after considering entire available dataset
soil_suborder	classified by USDA NCRS taxonomy (or Canadian or Australian taxonomy, if applicable); classifications either provided by paper, found via coordinates and Web Soil Survey, or found by a name locator and WSS
duration_first	months from first C application to harvest/measurement
duration_last	months from last C application to harvest/measurement
C_type		type of C added
C_rate		g C/m2 per year (missing data means that rate could not be calculated, likely because C mass was not provided)
C_calc		if the sawdust rate has been converted to g C/m2 based on an averaged conversion from papers (yes/no)
C_app			number of applications over the entire duration of the study
C_total		total amount of C added over the entire experiment (in g C/m2)
plant			plant identification, as specific as paper gets
plant_category	plant lifeform and duration as according to USDA Plants (or as defined in paper, especially if experiment occurred outside of USA)
plant_anper		annual/perennial, as defined by paper; "unknown" refers to either multiple categories (annual and perennial) or was not specified
plant_gfs		graminoid/forb/shrub, as defined by paper
plant_apgfs		annual/perennial and graminoid/forb/shrub, column calculated in R
seeding_native	if native plants were seeded (yes/no)
n_trt			sample size of treatment group
n_cntrl		sample size of control group
biomass		units are g/m2
cover			absolute or relative cover (units vary, decimal proportion, percent, or relative points)"
density		units are number of plants/m2, tillers/m2, or stems/m2
