column		details
paper			first author last name and year
cross			a crossed treatment (to identify/clarify observation only, not for analysis)
paper_ID		a few papers are combined because they are about the same experiment
exp_ID		an experiment occurs in the same location, over the same time period (roughly), executed by the same people; this is used to address non-independence
obs_ID		observation ID (every row is an observation); this is to address non-independence
biome			as defined by paper (with some adjustments to standardize categories)
region		defined after considering entire available dataset
soil_suborder	classified by USDA NCRS taxonomy (or Canadian or Australian taxonomy, if applicable); classifications either provided by paper, found via coordinates and Web Soil Survey, or found by a name locator and WSS
duration_first	months from first C application to harvest/measurement
duration_last	months from last C application to harvest/measurement
C_type		type of C added
C_rate		g C/m2 per year (missing data means that rate could not be calculated, likely because C mass was not provided)
C_calc		if the sawdust rate has been converted to g C/m2 based on an averaged conversion from papers
C_app			number of applications over the entire duration of the study
C_total		total amount of C added over the entire experiment (in g C/m2)
plant			plant identification, as specific as paper gets
plant_category	plant lifeform and duration as according to USDA Plants (or as defined in paper, especially if experiment occurred outside of USA)
plant_anper		annual/perennial, as defined by paper; "unknown" refers to either multiple categories (annual and perennial) or was not specified
plant_gfs		graminoid/forb/shrub, as defined by paper
seeding_exotic	units are seeds/m2. seeding rate is the total for experiment even if seeding occurred multiple times. relevant to the treatment of that row (applicable if seed mixture composition was provided). averaged if seeding treatments were pooled. missing data mean that seeding rate was reported in g/m2 (incompatible units)
seeding_native	units are seeds/m2. seeding rate is the total for experiment even if seeding occurred multiple times. relevant to the treatment of that row (applicable if seed mixture composition was provided). averaged if seeding treatments were pooled. missing data mean that seeding rate was reported in g/m2 (incompatible units)
biomass		units are g/m2
cover			absolute or relative cover (units vary, decimal proportion, percent, or relative points)"
density		units are number of plants/m2, tillers/m2, or stems/m2
